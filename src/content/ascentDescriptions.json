    "ascentOne": "Right after graduating engineering school, I started at BAE Systems as a systems engineer on the AEGIS Weapon System program, initially focused on traditional verification. I quickly identified gaps in our process and took the initiative to develop an automated data analysis framework  — a shift that led to BAE's first use of automation at a live fire event and caught the attention of our BAE business area's chief engineer.",
    "ascentTwo": "After co-developing the automated verification use case, I was selected as a delegate in a new technical leadership program for high-potential engineers across our business area. The program gave us R&D runway to build and implement cross-program use cases. This was my first opportunity to reach beyond AEGIS world, build a reusable capability, and start thinking across the BAE ecosystem.",
    "ascentThree": "After demonstrating the early verification capability, I pitched leadership on building a team focused on digitally transforming our legacy systems engineering workflows. What started as just me grew into a multi-disciplinary team spanning modeling, then eventually data analytics and cloud — and our work helped reposition AEGIS from a legacy program to a high-visibility innovation hub. At this point, solution architects and chief engineers were pulling us into proposals and demos across the business.",
    "ascentFour": "I became the first Advanced Technology Manager on the program and helped build the team from the ground up — a cross-functional org focused on delivery, growth, and building a culture where high performance felt energizing, not exhausting. I worked closely with the chief engineer in a dynamic that mirrored an EM/PM partnership: translating customer needs into real systems, tools, and roadmaps. Along the way, I shaped our team structure, brought in product rhythms like sprints and roadmaps, and mentored engineers into lead roles — what I'm most proud of."

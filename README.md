# about-me-site
This is a simple personal site for sharing my background and experience.

The site is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's meant to be clean, responsive, and easy to maintain as I continue learning and building.

## Features
- Responsive layout using Tailwind
- Clean, accessible typography
- Minimal design focused on content
- Hosted on Vercel

## Why
While my LinkedIn account is under verification, I built this as a straightforward way to share my experience, background, and current direction!

## License
This project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
